Service Accessibility
*********************

As with most scientific instruments, access to advanced functionality may be subject to certain conditions. This is due to the early state of the Platform and to the fact that it relies on limited resources, such as supercomputers.

Please see the below table for the services the Brain Simulation Platform (BSP) provides to different user classes at this point in time:
