Configure and run a rat hippocampus CA1 region using a preconfigured HBP model and data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This Use Case allows a user to configure and launch a simulation on the HBP 
HPAC infrastructure using `Unicore API <https://www.unicore.eu/>`__.

Run Simulations
===============

|run_simulation|

----------------

In the **top** section you can configure:

   |run_simulation_top|

-  ``Duration``: Stimulus duration, in milliseconds(ms)
-  ``Forward Skip``: Duration in milliseconds (ms) of running the
   simulation without stimulus and without reporting. This is to get the
   neuronal cells past any initial transience
-  ``View Simulations``: Here you can see the complete simulation history 
   (explained in section **2**)

--------------

In the **middle** section you can configure:

   |run_simulation_middle|

-  ``add`` new stimulus/report, ``edit`` or ``remove`` (You can also
   double-click on the timeline to add or edit)

   |edit_buttons|

-  ``Slices Selector`` allows to pick a slice of the hippocampus, it
   will add this to the *stimulus* / *report*

   |stimulus_selector|

-  ``Stimulations``

   -  For creation or edition of the item a form will appear with th following fields:

      -  *Target*: Name of the target that will receive the stimulation
      -  *Delay*: Starting time of the stimulus in milliseconds(ms)
      -  *Duration*: Duration of the stimulus in milliseconds(ms)  
      -  *Synapses per cell*: The number of synapses to create
      -  *Pattern*: Type of the stimulus [Poisson]
      -  *Lambda*: Configure the random distribution
      -  *Weight*: The strength of the created synapses


   |edit_stimulus|

-  ``Reports``

   -  For creation or edition of an item a form will appear:

      -  *Target*: Defines the region of interest, from where the data will be
         reported. Note that cell targets versus compartment targets can
         influence report behavior.
      -  *Type*: Soma (compartment) means that each compartment will have a 
         separate output in the report file. Synapse indicates that each
         synapse will have a separate entry in the report [compartment,
         synapse]
      -  *StartTime*: Time to start reporting(ms)
      -  *EndTime*: Time to stop reporting(ms)
      -  *Dt*: The reporting frequency in milliseconds(ms)
      -  *Format*: Defines the report output format [Bin, ASCII, HDF5]

   |edit_report|

--------------

In the **bottom** section you can ``launch`` the simulation

- This will open a form to configure the parameters before executing the jobs on the supercomputer:

 - *Title*: The title of the job
 - *Computer*: Which supercomputer will run the simulation.
 - *Nodes*: The amount of nodes that will be allocated and used for the simulation
 - *Run Time*: The maximum time before timeout (in seconds)
 - *CPUs Per Node*: The number of CPUs per node to be used 
 - *Project*: Select under which account you want to run the simulation.
 - *Preview Config*: This will open a new tab with the complete configuration that is going to be sent (BlueConfig)

   |run_simulation_form|

View Simulations
================

|view_simulation|

--------------

In the **top** you can: |view_simulation_top|

-  ``Filter`` by *Title*, *Status*, *Supercomputer*
-  ``Create Simulation``: this goes back to *Configure and Launch
   simulation* page
-  ``Reload``: to fetch the latest simulations and status

--------------

In the **middle** section you can:

|view_simulation_middle|

-  ``Check the status`` of Simulation and Analysis steps:

   - ready |done|
   - queue |sync|
   - aborted |block|
   - failed |error|

-  ``Run Analysis`` if no analysis was launched you can do it at the
   analysis step

   -  This will open a form to configure the parameters before executing
      the analysis on the supercomputer

      -  *Title*: Title of the job
      -  *Origin*: Supercomputer where the simulation output is located
      -  *Destination*: Supercomputer to which the output files from
         the simulation will be copied to, that will start the analysis
      -  *Nodes*: Number of nodes dedicated to the analysis job

         |run_analysis_form|

-  ``Delete`` the simulation
-  ``Abort`` the simulation

Simulation Details
==================

|simulation_details|

In the **top** section you can see:

|simulation_details_top|

- ``Simulation`` with the following information

   - *Name*
   - *ID*
   - *Status*
   - *Submission Date*
   - *Auto Sync* while the job is running reload the information

In the **middle** section you can see:

   |simulation_details_middle|

   - *Analysis*: Plots of the analysis will be shown here
   - *BlueConfig*: The configuration that was sent to run the simulation
   - *Unicore Logs*
   - *Stderr*: Logs of the simulation
   - *Stdout*: Output information of the simulation

The ``Analysis`` section shows the different analyses the user has run.
