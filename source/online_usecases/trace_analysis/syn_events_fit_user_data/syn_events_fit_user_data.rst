Synaptic events fitting (user’s data)
#################################################

This use case allows a user to fit synaptic events data with model from NeuroInformatics Platform.

Selecting this use case, one Jupyter Notebook is cloned in a private existing/new collab.  

By launching the notebook (Run All from the “Cell” menu), a simple graphical interface will guide the user to:

1. Select a local experimental file

   .. container:: bsp-container-center

       .. image:: images/select_exp.png
           :width: 400px
           :align: center
        
   |
 
   At this time, the only accepted format for the experimental file is a text file with time in the first column and individual traces in successive columns. All columns must be of the same length.

   |

2. Fill the form with the values needed to write a configuration file: the number of traces in the experimental file, the protocol (voltage clamp amplitude and reversal potential of the synapse). The name of the parameters to be fitted, their initial values and allowed range of variation, exclusion rules, and an optional set of dependencies for other parameters are by default those corresponding to the model from NeuroInformatics Platform

   .. container:: bsp-container-center

       .. image:: images/fill_form.png
           :width: 400px
           :align: center

   .. container:: bsp-container-center

       .. image:: images/dependencies.png
           :width: 500px
           :align: center
        
|

3. Configure the parameters of the optimization job: number of nodes, number of cores and runtime. Run the fitting procedure on JURECA or on MARCONI using UNICORE authentication, or on the NSG and check the status of the job

   On JURECA the number of nodes, number of CPUs per node and runtime are set by default to 2, 24 and 10m respectively
   
   |
   
   On MARCONI the number of nodes, number of CPUs per node and runtime are set by default to 2, 36 and 10m respectively
   
   |
   
   The user needs to be aware of the limitations imposed by each HPC system on resources
   
   |
   
   On the NSG the number of nodes, number of cores and runtime are set by default to 2, 24 and 0.5 respectively. The maximum number of nodes available per job is 72. If you require more than 72 nodes please contact nsghelp@sdsc.edu. The maximum number of cores required per node is 24.

   The user can choose to fit all the experimental traces 100 times, a single trace 20 times or a demo version where a trace is fitted 5 times. For the single trace and the demo version the user can choose the number of the trace to be fitted.

   |

   Once the job is completed, the output files will be in the collab storage under different directories, according to the system used.
   
   |
   
   JURECA: results are saved under the results/output_submissionTime folder;
   
   |
   
   MARCONI: results are saved under the resultsMarconi/output_submissionTime folder; 
   
   |
   
   NSG results are saved under the resultsNSG/output_submissionTime folder.

   |

4. Analyse the optimized parameters. The user may visualize:

   4.1. The results table (sorted in ascending order by the fitting error).
                        
   .. container:: bsp-container-center

    .. image:: images/results_table.png
     :width: 700px
     :align: center
              
   |
   |
 
   4.2.	The boxplot of the normalized results.
   
   .. container:: bsp-container-center

    .. image:: images/results_box.png
     :width: 700px
     :align: center
              
   |
   |
 
   4.3.	The best fit.
 
   .. container:: bsp-container-center

    .. image:: images/results_fit.png
        :width: 700px
        :align: center
   
   |

   The user may analyse the optimized parameters for a default data and mod file combination or browse through the optimized parameters available in the collab storage and visualize the table data, the box plot and the best fit. Once a collab storage folder is chosen, the user must select a corresponding experimental file (txt file), configuration file (txt file) and a result file (csv file).

Warnings
    •	Each notebook cell has two square bracket on the left. 
    
        1.	When are empty, it means that the code was never run before

        2.	When there is an asterisk [*], it means that the code is running
        
        3.	When there is a number, it means that the code was run. A progressive numbering scheme define the order in which the cells were run
        
    •	Each time a notebook is executed, a kernel status symbol is displayed in the top right corner of the notebook
    
        1.	When there is a circle bullet •, it means that the kernel is running and the user have to be sure to not interfere with the code execution
        
        2. When there is an empty circle bullet ○, it means that the kernel is idle and the user can interfere with the notebook
        
        
    •   After sending a job to the HPC systems: 
        
        1. The collab page MUST NOT be closed. 

        2. The web page MUST NOT be closed. 

        3. The browser MUST NOT be closed. 

        4. If the connection is interrupted, the user cannot recover the results. 

        5. The page MUST remain always active to retrieve the results.
