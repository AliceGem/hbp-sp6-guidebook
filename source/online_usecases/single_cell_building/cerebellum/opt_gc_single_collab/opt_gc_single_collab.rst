Mono compartmental Cerebellar Granule cell running on the collab.
Mono compartmental Cerebellar Granule cell optimization performed with BluePyOpt (Martina Rizza). The same data was used with the Optimizer Framework (Masoli et al., 2017)
The model is an adaptation of a mono compartmental granule cell NEURON model (D'Angelo' et al., 2001)
